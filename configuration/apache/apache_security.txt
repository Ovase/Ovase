// Security tip: Disable folder indexing in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf :
// This disables people getting a folder listing for folders without an index.php or index.html

// You probably have something like this by default:

<Directory "/var/www/html">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Require all granted
</Directory>

// Remove the "Indexes" option, such that:

<Directory "/var/www/html">
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Require all granted
</Directory>

// Also, some files should be protected from external access, such as the sql_user.json file (which contains sql user and password)

<Files "*.secret">
    Require all denied
</Files>
